## About Me
I am Junior Frontend Developer with teamwork experience in stressful situations.

My way in programming started with courses in IT-Academy and continues in RS School. At this moment I have been created about 5 projects and implemented about 55 tasks at Codewars, algorithmic tasks and etс.

In the near future I would like to improve my skills in JavaScript and to master TypeScript and React.
